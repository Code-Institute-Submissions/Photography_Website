## The Idea



# UX
**External User Story**



**Site Owners Potential**

The possibility to provide users with the ability to get an ingredients list to build a shopping list and to add items to a shopping cart. 

Reports could be made to provide feedback on the age-specific recipes being favourited, advertising can also be customized to target 'age' specific audiences.

Login/registration features will provide the site owner with a customer database which in future can be used to build and maintain customer relationships.
